Titus Adeyemi Alonge is currently studying Sustainable Land Management at the University of Energy and Natural Resources, Sunyani, Ghana (https://uenr.edu.gh). I advocate food security, Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN), and Sustainable Land Management. My research aims to study sustainable agriculture, focusing mainly on soil and water conservation using remote sensing techniques (satellites, aircraft, and UAVs) and Geographical Information Science (GIS).

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
