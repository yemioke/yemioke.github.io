Titus Adeyemi Alonge is currently studying Sustainable Land Management at the University of Energy and Natural Resources, Sunyani, Ghana [UENR](https://uenr.edu.gh). I advocate food security, Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN), and Sustainable Land Management. My research aims to study sustainable agriculture, focusing mainly on soil and water conservation using remote sensing techniques (satellites, aircraft, and UAVs) and Geographical Information Science (GIS).
